## MyFitnessPall Automation Project

***

**Project overview**

In this project, I'm testing the main functionality of
 the website https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ and his mobile application
 on this site. The main purpose of this project to obtain common and optimal 
 infrastructure for Web and Mobile platforms.
  Thus, I decided to use Bottom-up approach for this project. This kind of
 architecture uses separate small parts of the system and linked to
  form larger components, which are in turn linked to a complete
  system is formed.
